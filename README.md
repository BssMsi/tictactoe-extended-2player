# tictactoe-extended-2player
Implementation of an advanced version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in python.
2 player as of now, next step to try player vs computer

Rules:
1. There are two levels which you have to keep in mind while playing.
2. You are to occupy the cells as in TicTacToe to get 3 cells in a row, column or diagonal by placing 'X' or 'O' in the subcells.
3. A cell is said to be occupied when you get 3 subcells in a row, column or diagonal.
4. In whichever subcell you place an 'X' or 'O', you will be taken to the corresponding cell on the big board, in which cell you can play next.
5. In case, that cell has already been occupied, the player can play in any of the available cells.
6. Thought TicTacToe was boring? Think again !! :)
